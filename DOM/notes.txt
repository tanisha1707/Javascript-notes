The Document Object Model, usually referred to as the DOM, is an
essential part of making websites interactive. It is an interface that allows
a programming language to manipulate the content, structure, and style of
a website. JavaScript is the client-side scripting language that connects to
the DOM in an internet browser.

DOM provides multiple properties and methods to dynamically maniulate the content of HTML  document using javascript .
You can use different methods like getElementById, getElementsByTagName, and querySelector to access specific elements on a webpage.

for ex:- <body>
    <h1 id="demo">This is some text.</h1>
    <button onclick="changeText()">
      Change Text
      </button>

    <script>
        function changeText() {
            let element = document.getElementById("demo");
            element.textContent = "Text changed by JavaScript!";
        }
    </script>
</body>

1. using getElementById we can access html elementsusing their id's.
   using getElementByClass we can access html elementsusing their class.
   using getElementByTag we can access html elementsusing their Tag.
2.innerText :- shows the visible text continued in a node 
3.textContent :- shows all the full text
